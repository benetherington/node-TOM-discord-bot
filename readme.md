# TOMbot for Discord

Written by Ben Etherington in 2022 as an adaptation of the [Python version](https://github.com/benetherington/discord-bot).

Code reviewing and mentorship kindly provided by [Fonji](https://github.com/fonji).

## INTENT

This bot automates tasks for [The Orbital Mechanics Podcast](http://orbitalpodcast.com).

This repo can serve as a template for new bots, but isn't intended to be forked
and run without modifications. It's fairly specifc to our needs, and isn't
inteded to be highly configurable. With that said, if you update `src/*.json`
and add DISCORD_TOKEN to your environment variables, you could probably get a
copy running without much effort.
